### Thomas Welch 24 Feb 1819 &mdash; ?

### Bio

#### The following is an excerpt from a book published by Chapman Brothers, 1884.

Thomas Welch, farmer, section 19, Flynn Township, was born Feb. 24, 1819, on Grand River, in Chatham, Province of Lower Canada, and is the son of William and Mary Welch. His parents moved to Upper Canada when he was 12 years old, and at the age of 17 he came to Chicago and Galena, Ill., where he spent 12 years. He was employed about 14 years in the lead mines at the latter place, afterward returning to Canada. He was married at Malahide, Ont., Oct. 20, 1850, to Mary Brooks, a native of that place, where she was born Jan. 6, 1829. Eleven children have been born of her marriage, four of whom are deceased. They were named Mary G., Charles, Daniel, Walter, Alma, Catherine E., Levi, Junius, Andrew, Ellen, and Laura. The four last named are deceased. Mr. Welch was a resident of Elgin Co., Can., after his marriage about 20 years, and operated as a farmer on 100 acres of land of which he was the proprietor. He removed thence to Lambton County, where he remained until 1882. He owned 70 acres of land and at the date named disposed of his property by sale and came to Flynn Township, where he purchased 80 acres of land situated on sections 18 and 19 and where he has since been vigorously and successfully engaged in improving his farm. He is a Republican in political sentiment.
