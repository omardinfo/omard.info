### John McKellar 13 April 1823 — 18 Feb 1885 (aged 61)

### Bio

#### The following is an excerpt from a book published by Chapman Brothers, 1884.

John McKellar, farmer, section 25, Flynn Township, was born April 13, 1823, in Elgin Co., Ont. When he was four years of age, his parents removed to Middlesex Co., in the Dominion, where he was reared to the profession of farming. He remained with them until their deaths—that of the father occurring in July 1854, when he was 77 years old. The mother died in May 1854, aged 73 years. After they died the son became the owner of the homestead, and he continued its management until April 1879, when he came to Michigan and purchased 280 acres of land on sections 24 and 25, which was under partial improvement. He has purchased 160 acres additional since and has 60 acres improved. A considerable portion of his estate is divided among his sons. He has erected a good farmhouse and other farm buildings.

He was married April 5, 1855, in Middlesex Co., Ont., to Catherine McNeil, who was born in 1833, in that county. The children of Mr. and Mrs. McKellar are named Dugald, Christie, Henrietta, Peter, Alexander, Anna, Kate, John, Maggie, Mary, Flora and Donald.

Mr. McKellar is a farmer of more than ordinary abilities and ranks fairly among agriculturalists of Sanilac County. He is a Democrat in political views. He and his wife are members of the Disciples’s Church. His parents were natives of Scotland.
