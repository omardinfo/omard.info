I found this interesting information on FindAGrave.com. After reading, I contacted the author of this post, who is a descendant of the Flynn family via Ruth Ellen Flynn Hook. He gave me permission to re-publish this information and informed me that he got his information from a relative who has since passed.

<blockquote>
<p>William Henry Ellington ran away on 24 May 1829 from the English Army because he was indentured to serve the rest of his life in the Army. He set sail from Plymouth, England on 24 of May 1829; after 9 weeks and 2 days on the ship, he landed in Pickering, Ontario, Canada. Arriving in Canada, he changed his name to Thomas Flynn. He lived there until the fall of 1855. He moved and settled in Lexington, Sanilac County, Michigan. Shortly afterward he moved to Omard Township section 36, which is now Flynn Township. He met Rachel Boothby’s parents on the ship coming to America and he and Rachel married shortly afterward.</p>

<p>He was the first man buried in Peck Cemetery (Elk Township Cemetery). In 1855 Thomas bought part of William Fitch’s land and returned the following spring with his family. They were the first family to live in the township section 36. Fitch moved out of the area shortly afterward. Thomas Flynn remained until his death.
In January 1858 Ruth Ellen Flynn was born she was the first white child born in the area. The house she was born in is still standing; one mile north of Peck and Melvin roads. In 1869 township elections were held in the home of Thomas Flynn and he was elected supervisor.
Thomas and Rachel had 12 other children, 8 of them born in Michigan, including Ruth Ellen.</p>
